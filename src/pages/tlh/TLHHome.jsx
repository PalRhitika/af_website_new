           Nepal faces a severe gender gap in IT, with only 0.5% of economically active women working in ICT and just 7.8% of researchers being womenâ€”figures that are worse than the already low global averages (28% of IT jobs and 15.9% of engineering roles held by women worldwide). This underrepresentation stems from deep-rooted gender biases, societal norms, limited STEM education access, discrimination, lack of mentorship, and insufficient family support, which collectively discourage talented women from entering or advancing in technology careers.

          The Tech LeadHers Fellowship, launched by the Aaviyanta Foundation on January 2, 2024, is an initiative designed to empower young women in Kathmandu's tech industry, specifically targeting Ward 17 of Kathmandu Metropolitan City. The program's mission is to develop women's leadership in technology and create gender-inclusive narratives for lasting community impact, with an ambitious vision of having 50% of IT companies in Kathmandu led by women. It provides participants with technical training, mentorship, and opportunities to address local community challenges.
