            The journey began with an intensive bootcamp that brought together
            aspiring women in tech from diverse backgrounds. For many, this was
            their first foray into the world of programming and technology. The
            bootcamp laid a solid foundation, focusing on basic coding languages,
            software development, and problem-solving techniques. The initial
            phase was intense, but it set the stage for the participants to delve
            deeper into more advanced topics.

            Following the bootcamp, the program transitioned into a series of
            weekly sessions. These sessions were meticulously designed to build
            on the participantsâ€™ existing knowledge and prepare them for the
            challenges ahead. They covered advanced programming, leadership
            development, project and product management, and practical
            problem-solving. Each session was an opportunity for the participants
            to hone their skills further, gaining confidence and competence with
            every passing week.
